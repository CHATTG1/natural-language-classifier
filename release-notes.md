- **Classify multiple phrases**

    A new **Classify multiple phrases** method is available that supports sending up to 30 text phrases in one request. The `POST /v1/classifiers/{classifier_id}/classify_collection` method supports classifying phrases in the same languages as for the original method, except for Japanese, which launches as a beta feature.

    For details about the API call, see the **Classify multiple phrases** method in the [API reference ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/curl.html?curl#classify-multiple-phrases){:new_window}.

- **Train with larger data sets**

    You can now include up to 20,000 records in your training data. Classifier training is now enhanced by IBM Deep Learning as a Service. This offering is a neural network training infrastructure that uses an elastic cluster of graphics processing units (GPU) to handle larger data sets. The maximum size of the training data remains at 15,000 records for users in the Frankfurt region or users withÂ IBM Cloud Dedicated.
